# Sim2real
This repo present my work in Cobot project funded by Foxconn Interconnect Technology. Due to the confidentiality, I'm unable to provide source code but show some outcomes.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop capabilities for autonomous, collaborative robots performing tasks in a manufacturing environment. I'm responsible for developing object detection and pose estimation pipeline for small, relective, symmetric USB type-c components. My mainly contribution is focusing on:
* Improved the performance of self-developed real data labeling tool
* (Ongoing) Generated synthetic datasets to train Mask R-CNN model, compared with training with real datasets
* (Ongoing) Physical simulation experiment to collect stable poses for objects with arbitrary shapes
* (Ongoing) Pose estimation based on Augmented Autorencoder.

## Labeling GUI improvements
